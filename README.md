# mlx90614-spin 
---------------

This is a P8X32A/Propeller 1, P2X8C4M64P/Propeller 2 driver object for the Melexis MLX90614 IR thermometer

**IMPORTANT**: This software is meant to be used with the [spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/spin-standard-library) (P8X32A) or [p2-spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/p2-spin-standard-library) (P2X8C4M64P). Please install the applicable library first before attempting to use this code, otherwise you will be missing several files required to build the project.

## Salient Features

* I2C connection at up to 100kHz
* Reads IR channels 1 and 2 (ch2 availability dependent on device package)
* Reads ambient temperature sensor
* Returns temperature in centi-degrees (hundredths) Kelvin, Celsius or Fahrenheit

## Requirements

P1/SPIN1:
* spin-standard-library
* P1/SPIN1: 1 extra core/cog for the PASM I2C engine

P2/SPIN2:
* p2-spin-standard-library

## Compiler Compatibility

* P1/SPIN1 OpenSpin (bytecode): Untested (deprecated)
* P1/SPIN1 FlexSpin (bytecode): OK, tested with 5.9.7-beta
* P1/SPIN1 FlexSpin (native): OK, tested with 5.9.7-beta
* ~~P2/SPIN2 FlexSpin (nu-code): FTBFS, tested with 5.9.7-beta~~
* P2/SPIN2 FlexSpin (native): OK, tested with 5.9.7-beta
* ~~BST~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~Propeller Tool~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~PNut~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)

## Limitations

* Doesn't support changing the device's slave address
* Doesn't support PWM mode (unplanned)
